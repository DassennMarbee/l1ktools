Find more information about the project at http://lincscloud.org/\r\n\r\n# Code Access\r\n***\r\nTo get access to the code, please fork our repository by clicking the link above.\r\n\r\n# Analysis Tools\r\n***\r\n\r\nA brief description of the tools included in this software package is\r\ngiven below. The Matlab implementation of the tools is currently the\r\nmost mature. Some basic utilities in R and java are also included. We\r\nwill update the tools as they become available.\r\n\r\n# Matlab Tools: matlab/\r\n***\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n1. Matlab R2009a and above\r\n2. Statistics Toolbox\r\n\r\nTools:\r\n\r\n1. **dpeak_demo.m**\t\tDemonstrates basic usage of the scripts. \r\n2. **l1kt_dpeak.m** \tPerforms peak deconvolution for all analytes in a single LXB\r\n\t\t\tfile, and outputs a report of the detected peaks.\r\n3. **l1kt_plot_peaks.m**\tPlots intensity distributions for one or more analytes in \r\n\t\t\tan LXB file.\r\n4. **l1kt_parse_lxb.m**\tReads an LXB file and returns the RID and RP1 values.\r\n5. **l1kt_liss.m** \t\tPerforms Luminex Invariant Set Smoothing on a raw (GEX) input \r\n\t\t\t.gct file\r\n6. **l1kt_qnorm.m**\t\tPerforms quantile normalization on an input .gct file\r\n7. **l1kt_infer.m**\t\tInfers expression of target genes from expression of landmark \r\n\t\t\tgenes in an input .gct file\r\n\r\nSee the documentation included with each script for a details on usage\r\nand input parameters.\r\n\r\nDemo:\r\nTo run the demo, start Matlab, change to the folder containing dpeak_demo and\r\ntype dpeak_demo in the Command Window. This will read a sample LXB\r\nfile (A10.lxb), generate a number of intensity distribution plots and create a\r\ntext report of the statistics of the detected peaks (A10_pkstats.txt).\r\n\r\n# R Tools: R/\r\n***\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n1. R versions 2.9 and above\r\n2. prada package: http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/prada.html\r\n\r\n1. **lxb2txt.R**\tSaves values from an LXB file as a tab-delimited text file.\r\n2. **lxb2txt.sh**\tBash wrapper to lxb2txt.R \r\n\r\n# Java Tools: java/\r\n***\r\n1. **lxb-util.jar**\tJava routine for parsing LXB files (source included).\r\n\r\n# Data format\r\n***\r\nBead-level measurements from each detected well in L1000 assay are\r\nstored as binary .LXB files. The LXB files conform to the FCS 3.0 data\r\nfile standard, commonly used to store flow cytometry data.  For\r\ndetails see: http://isac-net.org/home.aspx\r\n\r\nThe two main measurement parameters are: \r\n\r\n1. RID: \t<32 bit unsigned integer> Reporter identifier. Values ranging\r\n\t[1-500] specifies the bead color/region. RID=0 refer to events\r\n\tthat flowcytometer software was unable to classify.\r\n\r\n2. RP1: \t<32 bit unsigned integer> Reporter fluorescent intensity,\r\n\tquantifies transcript abundance of the gene interrogated by\r\n\tthe bead.\r\n\r\n# Python Tools: python/\r\n***\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n1. Python 2.6 and above (untested under Python 3)\r\n2. numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org)\r\n3. pytables (http://www.pytables.org/moin)\r\n4. blessings (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/blessings)\r\n\r\nSee the GCT class documentation in python/cmap/io/gct for example usage and methods\r\n\r\n# Software License\r\n***\r\nThis program is distributed under the terms of the BSD 2-Clause\r\nlicense.
